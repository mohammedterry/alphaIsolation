# To Do
For each of your three custom heuristic functions, 
   evaluate the performance of the heuristic using the included tournament.py script. 
   write up a brief summary of your results, 
       describing the performance of the agent using the different heuristic functions verbally 
       using appropriate visualizations.
       conclude 
           comparison of the different heuristics 
           your reasoning for choosing the heuristic you ultimately use.
  Submit the code file: game_agent.py
  Submit your analysis as: heuristic_analysis.pdf

# Neuroevolution
using a genetic algorithm, 
generations of neural networks have battled it out 
using selfplay reinforcement learning (unsupervised learning)
to evolve a network that is able to efficiently assess the position on a given gameboard 
and choose the next best move to win
based solely on intuition 
(i.e. without requiring any bruteforce lookaheads).
