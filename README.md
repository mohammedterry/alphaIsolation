# Neuroevolution
using a genetic algorithm, 
generations of neural networks have battled it out 
using selfplay reinforcement learning (unsupervised learning)
to evolve a network that is able to efficiently assess the position on a given gameboard 
and choose the next best move to win
based solely on intuition 
(i.e. without requiring any bruteforce lookaheads).
